1. Seller

    Doesn't seller require any skill training or marketing skill? Yes and no.
    Yes, if you want to be a professional seller, but no, because when you continously approche to the clients,
    you could already learn quite a lot from your client and other sellers.

    Just do your best and serve the client with your product/service, you could close out deal naturally.

    But yes, itsn't a short term journey.

2. Renter

    Anything could be rent out, and finding a job basically means people use your time and create profit
    by leveraging your skillset.

    So think about what you have, you should be able to find your telent and sell yourself.
