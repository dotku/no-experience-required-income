1. Seller

    Doesn't seller require any skill training or marketing skill? Yes and no.
    Yes, if you want to be a professional seller, but no, because when you continously approche to the clients,
    you could already learn quite a lot from your client and other sellers.

    Just do your best and serve the client with your product/service, you could close out deal naturally.

    But yes, itsn't a short term journey.

2. Renter

    Anything could be rent out, and finding a job basically means people use your time and create profit
    by leveraging your skillset.

    So think about what you have, you should be able to find your telent and sell yourself.

3. Peer-to-Peer Services Provider

    The rise of the sharing economy has created vast opportunities for individuals to offer peer-to-peer (P2P) services. This encompasses a wide range of activities, from ride-sharing and accommodation rentals to more niche services like pet sitting, tutoring, or offering experiences like guided tours in your city. The principle is simple: utilize your assets, skills, or time to provide value to others in your community or travelers.

    Platforms like Airbnb, Uber, TaskRabbit, and Rover make it easier than ever to connect with those in need of services. You donâ€™t necessarily need specific training to get started; much of the learning comes on the job, through interaction with clients and feedback.

    This approach requires minimal upfront investment but does demand good interpersonal skills and the ability to market your service effectively within these platforms. The flexibility and diversity of options mean you can start offering services based on your current capabilities and interests, then expand or pivot as you gain more insight into what works best for you and your clients.

    As with any endeavor, success might not be immediate, but persistence and quality service can lead to a steady income stream, all while working on your terms.
